# The MANIFEST.in specifies which files are copied over from a temporary directory to
# site-packages after ``pip install``. Examples can be found here:
# https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/40s8qw/simplify_your_manifestin_commands/ and
# https://blog.ionelmc.ro/presentations/packaging.

# Test what is included in the package by running ``python setup.py sdist`` and inspect
# the tarball.
