Roadmap
--------

We aim for improvements to ``respy`` in three domains: Economics, Software Engineering, and Numerical Methods.

Economics
^^^^^^^^^

* support the full model of Keane and Wolpin (1997)

Software Engineering
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* explore *Autotools* as a new build system
* research the *hypothesis* package to replace the hand-crafted property-based testing routines

Numerical Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* link the package to optimization toolkits such as *TAO* or *HOPSPACK*
* implement additional integration strategies following Skrainka and Judd (2011)
