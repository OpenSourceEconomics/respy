``respy`` is a tool to solve, simulate, and estimate structural econometric models. It provides the computational support for several research projects that analyze the economics driving agents' educational and occupational choices over their life cycle within the framework of a finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming model.

Please visit our `online documentation <https://respy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for
