    """Create the state space.

    The state space consists of all admissible combinations of the following elements:
    period, experience in OCCUPATION A, experience in OCCUPATION B, years of schooling,
    the lagged choice and the type of the agent.

    The major problem which is solved here is that the natural representation of the
    state space is a graph where each parent node is connected with its children's
    nodes. This structure makes it easy to traverse the graph. In contrast to that, for
    many subsequent calculations, e.g. generating the covariates for each state, a
    tabular format has better performance, but looses the information on the
    connections.

    The current implementation of ``states`` and ``indexer`` allows to have both
    advantages at the cost of an additional object. ``states`` stores the information on
    states in a tabular format. ``indexer`` is a matrix where each characteristic of the
    state space represents one dimension. The values of the matrix are the indices of
    states in ``states``. Traversing the state space is as easy as incrementing the
    right indices of ``indexer`` by 1 and use the resulting index in ``states``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_periods : int
        Number of periods in the state space.
    num_types : int
        Number of types of agents.
    edu_starts : List[int]
        Contains levels of initial education.
    edu_max : int
        Maximum level of education which can be obtained by an agent.

    Returns
    -------
    states : np.ndarray
        Array with shape (num_states, 6) containing period, experience in OCCUPATION A,
        experience in OCCUPATION B, years of schooling, the lagged choice and the type
        of the agent.
    indexer : np.ndarray
        A matrix where each dimension represents a characteristic of the state space.
        Switching from one state is possible via incrementing appropriate indices by 1.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> num_periods = 40
    >>> num_types = 1
    >>> edu_starts, edu_max = [10], 20
