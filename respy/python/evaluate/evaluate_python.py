    """Calculate the likelihood contribution of each individual in the sample.

    The function calculates all likelihood contributions for all observations in the
    data which means all individual-period-type combinations. Then, likelihoods are
    accumulated within each individual and type over all periods. After that, the result
    is multiplied with the type-specific shares which yields the contribution to the
    likelihood for each individual.

    Parameters
    ----------
    state_space : class
        Class of state space.
    data : pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame with the empirical dataset.
    periods_draws_prob : np.ndarray
        Array with shape (num_periods, num_draws_prob, num_choices) containing i.i.d.
        draws from standard normal distributions.
    tau : float
        Smoothing parameter for choice probabilities.
    optim_paras : dict
        Dictionary with quantities that were extracted from the parameter vector.

    Returns
    -------
    contribs : np.ndarray
        Array with shape (num_agents,) containing contributions of estimated agents.
