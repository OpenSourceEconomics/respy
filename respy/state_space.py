def _create_state_space(options):
    """Create the state space.

    The state space of the model are all feasible combinations of the period,
    experiences, lagged choices and types.

    Creating the state space involves two steps. First, the core state space is created
    which abstracts from levels of initial experiences and instead uses the minimum
    initial experience per choice.

    Secondly, the state space is adjusted by all combinations of initial experiences and
    also filtered, excluding invalid states.

    Notes
    -----
    Here are some details on the implementation.

    - In the process of creating this function, we came up with several different ideas.
      Basically, there two fringe cases to find all valid states in the state space.
      First, all combinations of state attributes are created. Then, only valid states
      are selected. The problem with this approach is that the state space is extremely
      sparse. The number of combinations created by using ``itertools.product`` or
      ``np.meshgrid`` is much higher than the number of valid states. Because of that,
      we ran into memory or runtime problems which seemed unsolvable.

      The second approach is more similar to the actual process were states are created
      by incrementing experiences from period to period. In an extreme case, a function
      mimics an agent in one period and recursively creates updates of itself in future
      periods. Using this approach, we ran into the Python recursion limit and runtime
      problems, but it might be feasible.

      These two approaches build the frame for thinking about a solution to this problem
      where filtering is, first, applied after creating a massive amount of candidate
      states, or, secondly, before creating states. A practical solution must take into
      account that some restrictions to the state space are more important than others
      and should be applied earlier. Others can be delayed.

      As a compromise, we built on the former approach in
      :func:`~respy.tests._former_code._create_state_space_kw94` which loops over
      choices and possible experience values. Thus, it incorporates some fundamental
      restrictions like time limits and needs less filtering.

    - The former implementation,
      :func:`~respy.tests._former_code._create_state_space_kw94`, had four hard-coded
      choices and a loop for every choice with experience accumulation. Thus, this
      function is useless if the model requires additional or less choices. For each
      number of choices with and without experience, a new function had to be
      programmed. The following approach uses the same loops over choices with
      experiences, but they are dynamically created by the recursive function
      :func:`_create_core_state_space_per_period`.

    - There are characteristics of the state space which are independent from all other
      state space attributes like types (and almost lagged choices). These attributes
      only duplicate the existing state space and can be taken into account in a later
      stage of the process.
