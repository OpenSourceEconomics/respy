    "# Tutorial - Unobserved Heterogeneity and Finite Mixture Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Unobserved heterogeneity is a concern in every econometric application. Keane and Wolpin (1997) face the problem that individuals at the age of sixteen report varying years of schooling. Neglecting the issue of measurement error, it is unlikely that the differences in initial schooling are caused by exogenous factors. Instead, the schooling decision is affected by a variety of endogenous factors such as parental investement, school and teacher quality, intrinsic motivation, and ability. Without correction, estimation methods fail to recover the true parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution would be to extend the model and incorporate the whole human capital investement process up to the age where initial schooling was zero. Although such a model would be extremely interesting, it is also almost infeasible to model that many factors in terms of modeling, computation and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another solution is to employ individual fixed-effects. Then, the state space comprises a dimension with has the same number of unique values as there are individuals in the sample. Thus, you have to compute the decision rules for every individual for the whole state space separately which is computationally infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keane and Wolpin (1997) resort to model unobserved heterogeneity with a finite mixture. A mixture model can be used to model the presence of subpopulations (types) in the general population without requiring the observed data to identify the affiliation to a group. In contrast to fixed-effects, the number of subpopulations is much lower than the number of individuals. There is also no fixed and unique assignment to one subpopulation, but relations are defined by a probability mass function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each type has a preference for a particular choice which is modeled by a constant in the utility functions. For working alternatives, $w$, the constant is in the log wage equation whereas for non-working alternatives, $n$, it is in the nonpecuniary reward. Note that ``respy`` allows for type-specific effects in every utility component. Keane and Wolpin (1997) call it endowment with the symbol $e_{ak}$ for type $k$ and alternative $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\log(W(s_t, a_t)) = x^w\\beta^w  + e_{ak} + \\epsilon_{at}\\\\\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid misspecification of the likelihood, $\\pi_k$ must be a function of all individual characteristics which are determined before individuals enter the model horizon and are not the result of exogenous factors. The type-specific probability $\\pi_k = f(x^\\pi \\beta^\\pi)$ is calculated with softmax function based on a vector of covariates $x^\\pi$ and a matrix of coefficients $\\beta^\\pi$ for each type-covariate combination.\n",

Note that, the distribution is also only specified for type 1 and 2 and the coefficients for type 1 are left out for a parsimonuous representation.
