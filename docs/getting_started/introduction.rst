Introduction
==============

``respy`` is a tool to solve, simulate, and estimate structural econometric models. It provides the computational support for several research projects that analyze
the economics driving agents' educational and occupational choices over their life cycle within the framework of a finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming model.

``respy`` is under ongoing development. We add new features every week and try to make it more flexible and easier to use without sacrificing execution speed. Our goal is to solve, simulate and estimate any model that falls under the classification of Keane-Wolpin-Eckstein models as proposed in a recent survey by `Aguirregabiria and Mira (2010) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407609001985>`_.

This class includes, for example, the following seminal models:

- Keane, M. P. & Wopin, W. I. (1997). `The Career Decisions of Young Men <https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/262080>`_, Journal of Political Economy, 105(3): 473-552.

- Keane, M. P. & Wopin, W. I. (1994). `The Solution and Estimation of Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming Models by Simulation and Interpolation: Monte Carlo Evidence <https:/\www.jstor.org/stable/2109768>`_, The Review of Economics and Statistics, 76(4): 648-672.

... and we are almost there!
