    "# Adding observables to the state space\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to introduce observable characteristics of an individual to the state space. A potential source of unobserved heterogeneity in the models of Keane and Wolpin (1994) and Keane and Wolpin (1997) stems from the fact that individual ability is not observed. The authors try to mitigate the influence by using a finite fixture model with four different types as the years of schooling at the start of the model horizon are potentially not exogenous. If we had data on ability, we could probably move some of the explanatory power of types to ability. Furthermore, making type probabilities dependent on the ability level, types become more economically interpretable."

For simplification, we treat our ability measure similar to IQ which was originally used to determine basic mental capabilities. Our single covariate is thus having an ability level higher than zero. Still, we keep the five point scale instead of a simpler two point scale to determine the impact on the size of the state space."
