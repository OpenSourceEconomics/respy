    "With ``respy`` you are able to prototype a model similar to [Keane and Wolpin (1997)]( https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/262080) in minutes. We will showcase the implementation of a the Robinson Crusoe economy as a discrete choice dynamic programming model. Throughout the notebook you find indented text which tell parts of Robinson's story and motivates the model. We will first set the scene with a broad introduction and then turn to the actual model specification. We continue by simulating the model and analyze its comparative statics. We then extend the model and showcase the estimation of the model parameters.  \n",

    "Just to be clear, don't missinterpret the fact that we explain ``respy`` using such a simplistic model. ``respy`` is not a toy and can just as well solve state-of-the-art structural models. It's just easier to explain respy in a situation where we don't have to explain a complicated model at the same time. "

    "> After setting sail against his parents wishes, being captured by pirates, escaping from them, building a plantation, and setting sail again to capture slaves in Africa, [Robinson Crusoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe) stranded on a small island. He is alone with one dog, two cats, and only some supplies. He goes fishing to make ends meet and if he is too tired he will relax in his hammock.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the discrete choice dynamic programming model, Robinson chooses every period to either go fishing, $a = 0$, or spend the day in the hammock, $a = 1$, to maximize his expected sum of discounted lifetime utiltiy. The utility of a choice, $U(s_t, a_t)$, depends on the state $s_t$, which contains information on the individual's characteristics, and the chosen alternative $a_t$. For working alternatives like fishing utility consists of two components, a wage and a non-pecuniary component.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    U(s_t, a_t) = W(s_t, a_t) + N(s_t, a_t)\n",

    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_a$ is normally a market rental price for the skill units generated in the exponential expression. Another interpretation is that $ln(r_a)$ is simply the constant in the skill units. The skill units are generated by two components. $x^w_{at}$ and $\\beta^w_a$ are the choice- and time-dependent covariates and parameters related to the wage signaled by superscript $w$. The last term, $\\epsilon_{at}$ is a random shock.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To estimate model parameters via maximum likelihood, ``respy`` relies on [``estimagic``](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic), an open-source tool to estimate structural models and more. That way, respy only has to implement the likelihood function of your model, the optimization and standard error calculation is done by estimagic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other optimization libraries, estimagic does not optimize over a simple vector of parameters, but instead stores parameters in a DataFrame, which makes it easier to parse them into the quantities we need, store lower and upper bounds together with parameters and express constraints on the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "For ``estimagic``, we need to pass constraints on the parameters in a list containing dictionaries. Each dictionary is a constraint. A constraint includes two components: First, we need to tell ``estimagic`` which paramters we want to constrain. This is achieved by specifying an index location which will be passed to `df.loc`. Then, define the type of the constraint. Here, we only impose the constraint that the shock parameters have to be valid variances and correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, we can add a column ``\"group\"`` which is identical to the category column. The estimagic dashboard will then contain one parameter convergence plot per group instead of plotting all parameters in the same figure. Since respy has quite many parameters, this will make the plots much more readable."
