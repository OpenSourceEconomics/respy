    "# Robinson Crusoe or 10 minutes to respy\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a short introduction to respy for new users. As economists love Robinsonades [<sup>1</sup>](#fn1), we will showcase the implementation of a Robinson Crusoe economy as a discrete choice dynamic programming model. Throughout the notebook you find indented texts which make you familiar with Robinson's story. We will first set the scene with a broad introduction and then turn to the precise model specification. We continue by simulating the model and analyze its comparative statics. We then extend the model and showcase the estimation of the model parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Just to be clear, don't misinterpret the fact that we explain **respy** using such a simplistic model. **respy** is not a toy and can just as well solve state-of-the-art structural models. It's just easier to explain **respy** in a situation where we don't have to explain a complicated model at the same time. "

    "> After setting sail against his parents' wishes, being captured by pirates, escaping from them, building a plantation, and setting sail again to capture slaves in Africa, [Robinson Crusoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Crusoe) stranded on a small island. He is alone with one dog, two cats, and only some supplies. He goes fishing to make ends meet and if he is too tired he will relax in his hammock. But, he cannot relax to often as storing food is a difficult task on a tropical island.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the discrete choice dynamic programming model, Robinson chooses every period $t = 0, \\dots, T - 1$ to either go fishing, $a = 0$, or spend the day in the hammock, $a = 1$, to maximize his expected sum of discounted lifetime utility. The utility of a choice, $U(s_t, a_t)$, depends on the state $s_t$, which contains information on the individual's characteristics, and the chosen alternative $a_t$. For working alternatives like fishing utility consists of two components, a wage and a non-pecuniary component.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $r_a$ is normally a market rental price for the skill units generated in the exponential expression. Another interpretation is that $ln(r_a)$ is simply the constant in the skill units. The skill units are generated by two components. $x^w_{at}$ and $\\beta^w_a$ are the choice- and time-dependent covariates and parameters related to the wage signaled by superscript $w$. $\\epsilon_{at}$ is a choice-specific random shock from the shock vector $\\epsilon_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma)$ for all choices. Shocks are usually correlated across choices in one period, but are independent across periods.\n",
    "\n",

    "The general assumption imposed on Robinson is that he is forward-looking and maximizes the expected present value of utility over the remaining lifetime. W.l.o.g. $t = 0$ and let $V(s_0)$ define the value of the maximization which is achieved by a sequence of choices, $\\{a_t\\}^T_{t = 0}$, such that every action is in the choice set, $a_t \\in C(s_t)$ and $s_{t + 1}$ adheres to the law of motion.

    "> At some point Crusoe notices that a group of cannibals occasionally visits the island and celebrate one of their dark rituals. But then, a prisoner can escape and becomes Crusoe's new friend Friday whom he teaches English. In return Friday can share his knowledge once to help Robinson improve his fishing skills, but that is only possible after Robinson tried at least once to go fishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common extension to structural models is to increase the choice set. Here, we want to add another choice called `\"friday\"` which affects the utility of fishing. The choice should be available once, starting with the third period, and only after Robinson has been fishing before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, we load the example models with the function, `rp.get_example_model`. The command for the former model is `params, options, df = rp.get_example_model(\"robinson_crusoe_basic\")`. You can use `with_data=False` to suppress the automatic simulation of a sample with this parameterization."

    "Turning to the `options`, we can see that the new covariate `\"contemplation_with_friday\"` is only affecting utility if Robinson is experienced in fishing and only for one interaction with friday. This naturally limits the interaction with Friday. The key `\"negative_choice_set\"` can be used to restrict the choice Friday to the third and following periods. The first key matches a choice. The value of the key can be a list of strings. If the string evaluates to `True`, a utility penalty ensures that individuals will never choose the corresponding states. There exist some states in the state space which will never be reached because choices are mutually exclusive or are affected by other restrictions. Filters under `\"core_state_space_filters\"` can be used to purge those states from the state space, reducing runtime and memory consumption."

    "## Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate model parameters via maximum likelihood, **respy** relies on [``estimagic``](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/estimagic), an open-source tool to estimate structural models and more. That way, **respy** only has to implement the likelihood function of your model, the optimization and standard error calculation is done by ``estimagic``. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other optimization libraries, ``estimagic`` does not optimize over a simple vector of parameters, but instead stores parameters in a ``pd.DataFrame``, which makes it easier to parse them into the quantities we need, store lower and upper bounds together with parameters and express constraints on the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "For ``estimagic``, we need to pass constraints on the parameters in a list containing dictionaries. Each dictionary is a constraint. A constraint includes two components: First, we need to tell ``estimagic`` which parameters we want to constrain. This is achieved by specifying an index location which will be passed to `df.loc`. Then, define the type of the constraint. Here, we only impose the constraint that the shock parameters have to be valid variances and correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, we can add a column ``\"group\"`` which is identical to the category column. The ``estimagic`` dashboard will then contain one parameter convergence plot per group instead of plotting all parameters in the same figure. Since **respy** has quite many parameters, this will make the plots much more readable."
