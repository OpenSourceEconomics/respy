    covariate
        A covariate always has a corresponding parameter and can be part of the rewards
        or other parts defined in ``params``. It has to be differentiated from a
        :term:`state <state space>` because a covariate is defined by some function
        :math:`g` on a :term:`state <state space>` :math:`s`.

    discrete choice
        A term used in economics and control theory to refer to settings in which two or
        more discrete alternatives are available.

    dynamic programming
        A mathematical optimization and a computer programming method which allows to
        break up a complex problem into smaller sub-problems in a recursive manner.

    finite-horizon
        A property of a problem or model where time usually lasts from 0 to some $T$.

    observable characteristic
        An observable characteristic is a trait of individuals which is exogenously
        determined. It can either be treated as constant or malleable by exogenous
        processes.

    state space
        The state space is the entirety of states in a structural model. Each state in
        the state space is unique and can also be thought of as a position on a playing
        field.

        The dimensions of the state space comprise the necessary information for the
        model which can either be endogenously determined like experiences or
        exogenously like :term:`observable characteristics <observable characteristic>`.
