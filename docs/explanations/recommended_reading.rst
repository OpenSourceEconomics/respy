===================

To gain a deeper understanding of the underlying economic model and the mathematical
methods used for solving and estimating this model as well as obtaining a small
overview of the relevant literature we suggest the following supplementary material
depending on your current state of prior knowledge.

Before jumping right into reading the original papers (Keane and Wolpin 1994; 1997) it
can be very helpful to refresh your knowledge on discrete choice dynamic programming.

#. **Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation** *(Kenneth Train, 2009)* This book gives a
   concise introduction to static discrete choice models and the difficulties
   encountered in their estimation.

#. **Economic Dynamics: Theory and Computation** *(John Stachurski, 2009)* In the first
   part of this book one finds a succinct introduction to deterministic and
   probabilistic dynamical systems. In particular, the topics Finite state Markov chains
   and Finite state dynamic programming are elucidated.

#. **The Structural Estimation of Behavioral Models: Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming
   Methods and Applications** *(Keane, Wolpin and Todd, 2011)* In this handbook chapter
   discrete choice dynamic programming models are introduced including some applications
   in the field of labor economics.

#. **Dynamic discrete choice structural models: A survey** *(Aguirregabiria and Mira,
   2010)* In this comprehensive survey a more mathematically rigorous treatment of the
   subject is given.
