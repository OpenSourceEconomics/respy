Explanations
============

Explanations help you deepen your knowledge on the concepts and topics behind
``respy``. The guides below showcase what type of economic models ``respy`` can be
applied to using the example of Keane and Wolpin (1997, :cite:`Keane.1997`), which 
constitutes not only a seminal contribution to labor economic and structural econometric 
literature, but also served as one of the foundation stones in ``respy``'s design and 
construction. The guides can therefore serve as inspiration for specifying your own 
model with ``respy``.
