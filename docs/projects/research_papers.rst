Bhuller, M., Eisenhauer, P. and Mendel, M. (2020). The Option Value of Education.
*Working Paper*.

    We provide a comprehensive account of the returns to education using Norwegian
    population panel data with nearly career-long earnings histories. We use variation
    induced by a mandatory schooling reform for an instrumental variables strategy as
    well as the validation of a full structural model. We discuss the trade-offs between
    the two approaches. Using the structural model, we go beyond the standard return
    concepts such as Mincer returns and the internal rate of return. This allows us to
    account for the sequential resolution of uncertainty and nonlinearities in the
    returns to education. Both give rise to option values as each additional year of
    schooling provides information about the value of different schooling choices and
    new opportunities become available. We are thus able to estimate the true return to
    education and find an important role for option values.

Eisenhauer, P. and Suchy, R. (2020). Robust Human Capital Investment under Risk and
Ambiguity. *Working Paper*.

    We build on the prototypical life cycle model of human capital investment Keane and
    Wolpin (1994) and study individual decision-making under risk as well as ambiguity.
    Individuals fear model misspecification and seek robust decisions that work well
    over a whole range of models about their economic environment. We describe the
    individual's decision problem as a robust Markov decision process. Our Monte Carlo
    analysis indicates that the empirical finding of large psychic cost of schooling is
    in part due to model misspecification by econometricians who only analyze individual
    investment decisions under risk. This changes the mechanisms driving schooling
    decisions and affects the ex ante evaluation of tuition policies.

Eisenhauer, P. (2019). `The Approximate Solution of Finite-Horizon Discrete Choice
Dynamic Programming Models: Revisiting Keane & Wolpin (1994)
<https://doi.org/10.1002/jae.2648>`_. *Journal of Applied Econometrics, 34* (1),
149-154.

    The estimation of finite‐horizon discrete‐choice dynamic programming (DCDP) models
    is computationally expensive. This limits their realism and impedes verification and
    validation efforts. `Keane and Wolpin (Review of Economics and Statistics, 1994,
    76(4), 648–672) <https://doi.org/10.2307/2109768>`_ propose an interpolation method
    that ameliorates the computational burden but introduces approximation error. I
    describe their approach in detail, successfully recompute their original quality
    diagnostics, and provide some additional insights that underscore the trade‐off
    between computation time and the accuracy of estimation results.
