Badini, S. (2021). On the empirical identification of time preferences in discrete
choice dynamic programming models.

    The thesis assesses the practical identification of the time preference
    parameters in a discrete choice dynamic model of occupational choice, after
    introducing empirically-motivated exclusion restrictions that influence the
    size of the agents' choice set. In particular, agents may or may not face
    future employment restrictions that depend deterministically on their
    educational choices: Future-oriented agents take the restrictions into
    account when deciding on their level of education. The thesis sheds light on
    time preference parameters, which are underidentified in structural models of
    dynamic discrete choices. Underidentification is especially problematic for
    counterfactual analysis, since information on time preferences are needed to make
    any statement about the behavioral response of the agents to a policy
    intervention. In the literature, both theoretical arguments for identification and
    empirical identification strategies exploit, with mixed results, variables that
    leave the per-period utility function unaffected,This while being relevant to the
    agents' decisions. The intuition is that comparing the behavioral response of
    similar agents to different (expected) futures may reveal information on their
    time preferences.

Kauf, B. (2020). Uncertainty propagation in the predictions of economic models.

    The thesis reconstructs and extends the original data of Keane and Wolpin (1997),
    compares its predictions to actual values and investigates the impact of uncertainty
    in the parameters on relevant quantities of interest. While some of the decision
    rules regarding the creation of the data set have to be infered, I manage to
    reasonably replicate the original data set up to 1987. In contrast, the predictions
    of the paper compare less well to the self-constructed data set as they overpredict
    both the share of individuals in the blue-collar sector and the average annual
    incomes of blue-collar workers and underpredict the share of individuals choosing
    the home option. A potential shortcoming of the model which leads to these
    differences is the missing incorporation of demand-side factors which have been
    shown to substantially affect occupational employment shares and incomes. As many
    of the individuals choosing the home option spend an extensive amount of time out
    of the labor force, factors that force individuals out of the labor force but are
    not included in the model such as health problems and incarceration have been
    identified as potential extensions of the model which could improve its predictive
    performance. Using a simulation approach, I find the estimated effects of an annual
    $2000 college tuition subsidy on total years of schooling and high school graduation
    rates to be robust to the introduction of uncertainty in the parameters whereas the
    robustness of the estimated effect on college graduation rates appears less clear
    and might be underestimated.

Maokomatanda, L. (2020). Sensitivity Analysis for Structural Microeconomic 
Models using Shapley Values.

    This thesis computes the Shapely values for the estimated model parameters
    in Keane and Wolpin (1994) to assess their relative quantitative importance for
    the model's counterfactual predictions. The parametric uncertainties in the analysis
    of structural microeconometric models are ubiquitous. However, sensitivity analysis
    is rare and particularly challenging in this setting due to many correlated
    parameters. Shapely values with their foundation in game theory appear particularly
    suited in this case.

Mensinger, T. (2020). On the Use of Surrogate Models in Structural Microeconometrics.

    The thesis applies the ideas of surrogate modeling to the human capital
    model by Keane and Wolpin (1994) to facilitate the application of
    uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analysis. The analysis
    demonstrates that surrogate models do not outperform a brute force
    approach when propagating the model's parametric uncertainty to selected
    quantities of interest to economists. However, surrogate models are
    essential to also conduct a subsequent sensitivity analysis and machine
    learning methods are useful to calibrate a surrogate to high precision.

Gehlen, A. (2020). Simulation-Based Estimation of Discrete Choice Dynamic Life-Cycle
Models.

    The thesis revisits the models by Keane and Wolpin (1994, 1997) to explore Method of
    Simulated Moments (MSM) estimation as an alternative to the Simulated Maximum
    Likelihood (SML) approach used by the authors. The thesis discusses the various
    calibration choices needed to construct an appropriate MSM criterion function for
    estimation, as well as the challenges that come with optimization of the criterion.
    The analysis demonstrates that the MSM can be effectively employed for model
    estimation but simultaneously shows that results are very sensitive to calibration
    choices.

Suchy, R. (2020). Robust Human Capital Investment.

    The thesis enriches the treatment of uncertainty in discrete choice dynamic
    programming models applied to human capital investment decisions. It extends the
    Keane and Wolpin (1997) life cycle model by a deliberate account of ambiguity.
    Individuals fear model misspecification and seek robust decision rules that work
    well over a whole range of models about their economic environment. The
    literature on robust optimization informs the implementation of a robust value
    function iteration procedure that induces robust policies. The resulting robust
    human capital model is calibrated to a sample of young men from the National
    Longitudinal Survey. The empirical validation of the model testifies its
    capability to appropriately match behavioral patterns in the data, to predict
    occupational choice decisions, and to improve the out-of-sample fit compared to
    a risk-only model. It carries novel implications for the ex-ante evaluation of
    educational policies. In case of a tuition subsidy, predictions from a
    misspecified risk-only model may embellish their efficacy. Given a particular
    tuition subsidy, a targeted intervention that reduces the level of ambiguity may
    increase the demand for education.

Stenzel, T. (2020). Uncertainty Quantification for an Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin model with
correlated input parameters.

    The thesis analyzes the uncertainty of the effect of a 500 USD subsidy on annual
    tuition costs for higher education on the average years of education caused by the
    parametric uncertainty in the model of occupational choice by Keane and Wolpin
    (1994). This model output is called a quantity of interest (QoI). The uncertainty
    quantification (UQ) has two stages. The first stage is an uncertainty analysis, and
    the second stage is a quantitative global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The
    uncertainty analysis finds that the tuition subsidy has a mean effect of an increase
    of 1.5 years and a standard deviation of 0.1 years in education. For the qualitative
    GSA, I develop redesigned Elementary Effects based on Ge and Menendez (2017) for a
    model with correlated input parameters. Based on these Elementary Effects, I compute
    multiple aggregate statistics to quantify the impact of the uncertainty in one
    parameter on uncertainty in the QoI. However, the analysis does not lead to clear
    results as there is no consensus about how to interpret the aggregate statistics in
    this context - even for uncorrelated parameters.

Massner, P. (2019). Modeling Wage Uncertainty in Dynamic Life-cycle Models.

    The thesis sheds light on the validity of the modeling assumptions of wage
    uncertainty in dynamic life-cycle models of human capital investment. Since the
    pioneering work of Keane and Wolpin (1997), a majority of studies in this field
    followed the approach of assuming serially independent productivity shocks to wages.
    In the case of Keane and Wolpin (1997), the independence assumption indeed
    simplifies the numerical solution of the model compared to more complex
    specifications, such as serial correlation. However, the assumption of i.i.d.
    productivity shocks seems to be quite narrow in light of findings of the
    reduced-form literature stream on wage dynamics.

Raabe, T. (2019). A unified estimation framework for some discrete choice dynamic
programming models.

    The thesis lays the foundation for **respy** to become a general framework for the
    estimation of discrete choice dynamic programming models in labor economics. It
    showcases the ability to represent Keane and Wolpin (1994), Keane and Wolpin (1997),
    and Keane and Wolpin (2000) within a single implementation.
