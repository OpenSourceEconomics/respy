Template for tutorials
======================

*This document should serve as a template for all tutorials. If something is not covered
in here, please, extend it.*

To get in the right mood for writing a tutorial, read through two other tutorials and
focus on what language is used, how are things explained and the flow of the document.
Furthermore, go through this `checklist
<https://documentation.divio.com/tutorials/#how-to-write-good-tutorials>`_. Now, you are
ready

Goal
----

Describe what the goal and what the user should have learned by the end of this
tutorial.


Steps
-----

Most of content in tutorials are clearly defined steps which follow after another.

You have to omit a lot of background information you might find helpful to keep the
tutorial short and the user doing things. If you want to guide the user to further
material, use the following buttons.
