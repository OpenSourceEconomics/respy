Template for tutorials
======================

*This document should serve as a template for all tutorials. If something is not covered
in here, please extend it.*

In order to get started on a tutorial, please refer to the other :ref:`tutorials` to get
a feel of the structure and language you should use so your tutorial is aligned with the
rest of the documentation. Check out this `checklist
<https://documentation.divio.com/tutorials/#how-to-write-good-tutorials>`_ as an
additional resource to guide you through the writing process.

Goal
----

Describe the goal and what the user should have learned by the end of this
tutorial.


Steps
-----

Tutorials should be structured as clearly defined, sequential steps to reaching the
specified goal.

The tutorials should be short, focused, and concise. This means you might have to omit
background information that you consider helpful for understanding the underlying code
and theory. If you want to guide the user to further material like related
:ref:`explanations`, :ref:`how_to_guides`, and :ref:`reference_guides`, use the
following buttons.
