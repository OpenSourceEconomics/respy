further resources, and contact details.

Research
--------

Eisenhauer, P. (2019). `The Approximate Solution of Finite-Horizon Discrete Choice
Dynamic Programming Models: Revisiting Keane & Wolpin (1994)
<https://doi.org/10.1002/jae.2648>`_. *Journal of Applied Econometrics, 34* (1),
149-154.

    The estimation of finite‐horizon discrete‐choice dynamic programming (DCDP) models
    is computationally expensive. This limits their realism and impedes verification and
    validation efforts. `Keane and Wolpin (Review of Economics and Statistics, 1994,
    76(4), 648–672) <https://doi.org/10.2307/2109768>`_ propose an interpolation method
    that ameliorates the computational burden but introduces approximation error. I
    describe their approach in detail, successfully recompute their original quality
    diagnostics, and provide some additional insights that underscore the trade‐off
    between computation time and the accuracy of estimation results.

Thesis
------

Massner, P. (2019). Modeling Wage Uncertainty in Dynamic Life-cycle Models.

    The thesis sheds light on the validity of the modeling assumptions of wage
    uncertainty in dynamic life-cycle models of human capital investment. Since the
    pioneering work of Keane and Wolpin (1997), a majority of studies in this field
    followed the approach of assuming serially independent productivity shocks to wages.
    In the case of Keane and Wolpin (1997), the independence assumption indeed
    simplifies the numerical solution of the model compared to more complex
    specifications, such as serial correlation. However, the assumption of i.i.d.
    productivity shocks seems to be quite narrow in light of findings of the
    reduced-form literature stream on wage dynamics.

Raabe, T. (2019). A unified estimation framework for some discrete choice dynamic
programming models.

    The thesis lays the foundation for ``respy`` to become a general framework for the
    estimation of discrete choice dynamic programming models in labor economics. It
    showcases the ability to represent Keane and Wolpin (1994), Keane and Wolpin (1997),
    and Keane and Wolpin (2000) within a single implementation.
