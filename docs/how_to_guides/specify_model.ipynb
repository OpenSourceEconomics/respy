    "In short, we are working with a dynamic choice model which follows individuals as they decide between working and schooling at different points in their life-cycle. They accumulate experience based on their choices and are forward-looking individuals which take the value of future outcomes (which they discount by a factor $\\delta$) into account when making choices in the present. Simultaneously, all choices are subject to alternative-specific shocks which creates uncertainty about the future in the individuals' choice problem. The model of Keane and Wolpin (1994) constitutes a simplified version of the model discussed in the explanations. We can see the differences when assessing the reward and choice structure of the model.\n",

The reward for schooling includes an indicator $I(s_t \\geq 12)$ which is connected to the cost of schooling after 12 periods (i.e. post-secondary schooling costs) and component that captures costs of returning to school when the choice in the previous period was something else. Aside from the parameters connected to these various components, each reward function also contains a constant and an alternative specific shock. The skill price in occupations is denoted by $r_{a}$, it is set to 1 in this model. Note that the reward functions are not only time but also individual specific.

    "\n",
    "2. The `options` which specify the settings for the model solution and further restrictions on the model structure. `options` are defined in a Python `dictionary`. Examples of components that enter the options include the number of periods, type of numerical integration, unfeasible states, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next steps, we will examine these two components in detail to illustrate how they mirror the model outlined above. Since the model of Keane and Wolpin (1994) is already implemented, we can simply load it into memory."

For instance, a specified shock distribution may guide the model but exogenously set. The `params` DataFrame may also contain auxiliary parameters that aid simulation but do not stem from the value functions of the different choice alternatives. **respy** allows copious freedom in designing reward functions and naming parameters. However, certain rules need to be accounted for to allow **respy** to process a model correctly.

Lastly, the covariate `not_edu_last_period` is a boolean indicator for not having chosen *education* in the last period.
