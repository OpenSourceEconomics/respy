    "In this notebook we will explore the interface of respy in greater detail. In the following we will use the basic specification of the model established by [Keane and Wolpin (1994)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2109768?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), henceforth KW(1994), in their seminal paper. In respy, the specifications come pre-specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a model in respy is defined by two objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parameters of the model reside in `params` which is a [pandas.DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). It includes the structural parameters of the model which define the model structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    *Note:* It is not mandatory that parameters included in the `params` DataFrame have to be estimable. For example, a specified shock distribution may guide the model but exogenously set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The object `options` specifies settings for the model solution and further restrictions on the model structure. Examples may include number of periods, type of numerical integration, unfeasible states etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, we will load the KW(94) basic specification from the `respy` example models.   \n",
    "(Maybe: add location where to specify your own model).\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice rewards are central to define choices in general. First of all, each choice can have two categories of reward parameters which are named  in the `category` index level. `wage` and `nonpec` refer to the two components of utility functions for Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin models. In a nutshell, the utility of a working alternative is defined by the sum of a wage and a nonpecuniary component. The nonpecuniary reward $N$ is a vector product of parameters $\\beta^N$ and covariates $x^N$. The wage $W$ is defined as the exponential function of a vector product of parameters $\\beta^W$ and covariates $x^W$ plus a normally distributed shock $\\epsilon$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us take a look at the reward parameter for `fishing` and focus on `wage_fishing` first. The group contains a single parameter whose value is 0.1. Now, how is the parameter $\\beta$ multiplied with the correct covariate $x$? This is achieved by the `name` index level of the parameter. In this case, `exp_fishing` is the name of a column in an internal DataFrame which contains the experience in fishing for an individual. After the vector product is computed, a shock which is drawn internally is added to the sum and the value is exponentiated to receive the wage component for the choice `fishing`."
