    "One important component of the solution to the DCDP problem in **respy** models is numerical integration. A bottleneck in solving and estimating the model is the solution of the expected value function, the so-called $EMax(\\cdot)$. Solving the $EMax(\\cdot)$ requires us to solve a multi-dimensional integral at every point in the state space. The integrated value function does not have an analytical solution and thus requires the application of numerical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the models become more complex, the computational burden increases as adding new features to the model increases the required number of function evaluations, which are the costly operation in numerical integration. Numerical integration usually uses monte carlo simulation. Results from applied mathematics, however, suggest methods that are more efficient and thus enable a performance increase. For the same number of function evaluations (and hence computational cost) quasi-Monte Carlo methods achieve a significantly higher accuracy. **respy** thus enables users to select between various methods for the numerical approximation of the $EMax(\\cdot)$. The numerical integration is controlled in the `options` of a specified model.\n"
