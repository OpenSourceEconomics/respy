Acknowledgments
---------------

We are grateful to the `Social Science Computing Services <https://sscs.uchicago.edu/>`_
at the `University of Chicago <https://www.uchicago.edu/>`_ who let us use the Acropolis
cluster for scalability and performance testing. We appreciate the financial support of
the `AXA Research Fund <https://www.axa-research.org/>`_ and the  `University of Bonn
<https://www.uni-bonn.de>`_.

We are indebted to the open source community as we build on top of numerous open source
tools such as the `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org>`_ and `PyData <https://pydata.org/>`_
ecosystems. In particular, without **respy**'s interface would not work without `pandas
<https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ and it could not rival any program written in Fortran in
terms of speed without `Numba <http://numba.pydata.org/>`_.

Citation
--------

**respy** was completely rewritten in the second release and evolved into a general
framework for the estimation of Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin models. Please cite it with

.. code-block::

    @Unpublished{Gabler2020,
      Title  = {respy - A Framework for the Simulation and Estimation of
                Eckstein-Keane-Wolpin Models.},
      Author = {Janos Gabler and Tobias Raabe},
      Year   = {2020},
      Url    = {https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/respy},
    }

Before that, **respy** was developed by Philipp Eisenhauer and provided a package for
the simulation and estimation of a prototypical finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic
programming model. At the heart of this release is a Fortran implementation with Python
bindings which uses MPI and OMP to scale up to HPC clusters. It is accompanied by a pure
Python implementation as teaching material. If you use **respy** up to version 1.2.1,
please cite it with

.. code-block::

    @Software{Eisenhauer2019,
      Title  = {respy - A Package for the Simulation and Estimation of a prototypical
                finite-horizon Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming Model.},
      Author = {Philipp Eisenhauer},
      Year   = {2019},
      DOI    = {10.5281/zenodo.3011343},
      Url    = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3011343}
    }

We appreciate citations for **respy** because it helps us to find out how people have
been using the package and it motivates further work.
