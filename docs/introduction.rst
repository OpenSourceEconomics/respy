.. for what has respy been used?

``respy`` is a research tool. It provides the computational support for several research
projects that analyze the economics driving agents' educational and occupational choices
over their life cycle within the framework of a finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic
programming model.

Here is some of the recent work:

* Eisenhauer, P. (2016). `The Approximate Solution of Finite-Horizon Discrete Choice
  Dynamic Programming Models: Revisiting Keane & Wolpin (1994)
  <https://github.com/structRecomputation/manuscript/blob/master/eisenhauer.2016.pdf>`_.
  *Unpublished Manuscript*.

    The estimation of finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming models is
    computationally expensive. This limits their realism and impedes verification and
    validation efforts. Keane & Wolpin (1994) propose an interpolation method that
    ameliorates the computational burden but introduces approximation error. I describe
    their approach in detail, successfully recompute their original quality diagnostics,
    and provide some additional insights that underscore the trade-off between
    computation time and the accuracy of estimation results.

  *Unpublished Manuscript*.

    I instill a fear of model misspecification into the agents of a finite-horizon
    discrete choice dynamic programming model. Agents are ambiguity averse and seek
    robust decisions for a variety of alternative models. I study the implications for
    agentsâ€™ decisions and the design and impact of alternative policies.

We provide the package and its documentation to ensure the recomputability,
transparency, and extensibility of this research. We also hope to showcase how software
engineering practices can help in achieving these goals.

The rest of this documentation is structured as follows. First, we provide the
installation instructions. Then we present the underlying economic model and discuss its
solution and estimation. Next, we illustrate the basic capabilities of the package in a
tutorial. We continue by providing more details regarding the numerical components of
the package and showcase the package's reliability and scalability. Finally, we outline
the software engineering practices adopted for the ongoing development of the package.
