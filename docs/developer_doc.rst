The pre_processing directory
----------------------------

This directory contains code to process the model specifications and estimation dataset.
The code here is Python only. Speed is irrelevant since most of the functions here are
only called once (when a new model is defined) and not each time the model is solved.

The model_processing module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
