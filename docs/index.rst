``respy`` is an open-source Python package for the simulation and estimation of a
prototypical finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming model. We build on the
baseline model presented in:

    Keane, M. P. and  Wolpin, K. I. (1994). `The Solution and Estimation of Discrete
    Choice Dynamic Programming Models by Simulation and Interpolation: Monte Carlo
    Evidence <https://doi.org/10.2307/2109768>`_. *The Review of Economics and
    Statistics*, 76(4): 648-672.
