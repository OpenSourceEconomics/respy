``respy`` is a tool to solve, simulate, and estimate structural econometric models. It provides the computational support for several research projects that analyze
the economics driving agents' educational and occupational choices over their life cycle within the framework of a finite-horizon discrete choice dynamic programming model.

The package is under ongoing development. We add new features every week and try to make it more flexible and easier to use without sacrificing execution speed. Our goal is to cover any model that falls under the classification of Keane-Wolpin-Eckstein models as proposed in a recent survey by `Aguirregabiria and Mira (2010) <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407609001985>`_ and we are almost there. Already, you can replicate the seminal work by `Keane and Wolpin (1994) <https:/\www.jstor.org/stable/2109768>`_ and  `Keane and Wopin (1997) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/262080>`_.
